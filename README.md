Key Operations for a Data Analyst Role
1️⃣ Data Collection

Obtain raw data on Netflix’s content (e.g. via APIs, web scraping, internal databases, or CSV/Excel files).

Data sources could include content metadata: title, genre, release year, runtime, IMDB score, country of production, 
type (movie/show).


2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation

Handle missing values (e.g., missing IMDB ratings or genre tags).

Standardize and normalize text fields (e.g., consistent genre names: "Documentary" vs "documentation").

Convert data types (e.g., release_year as integer, runtime as numeric).

Split or merge fields where necessary (e.g., separate multiple genres into rows).


3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze distribution of content types: movies vs shows (as seen in the donut chart — ~65% movies, ~35% shows).

Identify top genres (as done in your bar chart: comedy, drama, documentation are top genres).

Assess runtime, average IMDB ratings, and trends over years (like the total_content year line chart).

Study geographic distribution (map visualization showing country-wise content spread).


4️⃣ Data Modeling (if required)

Build DAX measures or calculated columns for custom KPIs (e.g., total runtime, average rating per genre).

Create relationships between tables (content, countries, genres, ratings).

5️⃣ Visualization & Reporting

Use tools like Power BI (as in your screenshot) to:

Build interactive filters (genre, release_year, title).

Create charts, maps, and pie/donut visuals.

Allow end users  to drill down on the data.


6️⃣ Insights & Recommendations

Interpret the patterns: e.g., growth of Netflix content over years, most popular genres, regional content distribution.

Provide actionable insights (e.g. "Comedy dominates the library — potential to invest more in underrepresented genres").
